Data:

The project utilizes four datasets:

Regular Season (Players Stat): Contains individual player statistics for the regular season, including kills, deaths, assists, KDA, hero level, damage dealt, turret damage, gold earned, and more.
Regular Season (Teams Stat): Contains team-level statistics for the regular season, including average KDA, GPM, games won, lost, and played.
Playoffs (Players Stat): Similar to Dataset 1, but for playoff matches.
Playoffs (Teams Stat): Similar to Dataset 2, but for playoff matches.
Analysis:

The analysis involves:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring data quality and consistency.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics for player and team performance metrics.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts to explore data relationships and trends.
Statistical Analysis: Employing statistical techniques like correlation analysis, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify significant relationships and patterns.
MVP Identification: Developing criteria and methods to identify the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the tournament.
Key Findings:

KDA Distribution: The KDA distribution among players is positively skewed, indicating a majority of players have moderate KDA values with a smaller number of top-tier players.
Damage Dealt vs. Damage Received: There's a positive correlation between damage dealt and damage received, suggesting that aggressive playstyles often involve higher risk.
Team Performance: Analysis of team-level statistics can reveal which teams consistently perform well and identify factors contributing to their success.
MVP Identification: The identified MVP criteria and analysis can help determine the most deserving player based on individual performance, team impact, and other relevant factors.
Conclusion:

This project provides valuable insights into the player and team performance in Mobile Legends M5. The findings can be used to improve player development, team strategies, and the overall competitive balance of the game.
